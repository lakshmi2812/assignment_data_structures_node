1. O(1) --> constant time operation
2. O(n) --> because we have to shift every element in the array one position to
   the right. So, for an array of length size n, it is n times 0(1), which is
   O(n).
3. O(1) --> constant-time operation.
4. O(n) --> go through each element and convert to upper case.
5. O(n) --> linear time
6. 0(nlogn) --> because, best sorting algorithm we know(merge sort) takes
   O(nlogn) run-time.
7. O(n) --> because we need to look at every character in the string, and when
   we split we only have to look in the most recent split string, not any of the
   others.
8. O(1) --> No order, no traversing, just make a new element at a certain
   address in memory.
9. O(n) --> because obviously
